In order to have a docker container with billing-app available for the cucumber tests defined in order-app,
follow these instructions to have a local Docker registry (https://docs.docker.com/registry/) to which the
billing-app image can be pushed (alternatively, it could be pushed to DockerHub and made public, but I prefer not to):

1- Run the docker image that has the Docker registry:

docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry:2


2- Run billing-app jibDockerBuild Gradle Task to have the image built


3- Tag the image:

docker image tag billing-app-container localhost:5000/billing-app-container


4- Push it to the docker registry running locally in your Docker container:

docker push localhost:5000/billing-app-container


5- Verify that you can pull the image from your local Docker registry, by first removing it:

- Retrieve the image id
docker images

- Remove it with:
docker rmi [IMAGE_ID]

- Pull it from the local Docker registry like this:
docker pull localhost:5000/billing-app-container
